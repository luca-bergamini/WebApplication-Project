# WebApplication-Project
Web Application Project did for Web Application course at Polytechnic of Turin. During this course we studied how to build a website with it's own database.

Steps to make the application work:
- open two different terminals, one for client and one for server
- in both terminals do the command `npm install`
- in the server terminal do the command `nodemon index.js`
- in the client terminal do the command `npm run dev`
  
now you can click the http... link displayed in the client terminal to have a look of the website.

To login use the credentials written in the README file in the project folder.

Enjoy😁🦾
